# Spellify ðŸ§™âš¡
#### Date of completion: 9th July 2020

## Description
Today I decided to not work on anything related to the glorious MERN stack and wanted to make something else instead. I've been using a lot of chrome extensions which have helped boost my productivity and it turns out... making one is actually pretty darn easy! And so I proudly present my First Chrome Extension - Spellify. It replaces the 10 most commonly used words of the English language with Harry Potter spells! This can be used by anyone who wants to make it harder for themself to read texts or... is a huge Potterhead?

This extension doesn't have a popup or any other fancy features (for now) and is an extremely basic chrome extension.

## Key Learnings
* Building a chrome extension that works locally
* Discovering there are *way* more HP spells than I thought
* One needs to pay to publish an extension on the Chrome Web Store

## Acknowledgments
I would like to credit my really cool CS Professor Debayan Gupta (again) for being the reason behind my interest in CS. 
I would also like to thank my best friend "smol gurl" for being my biggest inspiration.
